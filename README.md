# ORM-E-Commerce-BackEnd-

## Description 
The motivation behind the project was to create a back end application for an e-commerce site so that relevent data (categories, product information, tag, etc) can be handled, viewed and managed properly. This was done using Express. js by connecting a MySQL database using Sequelize. We built this application because it allows users to see seeded data in an efficient way through the back end and then being able to manipulate that API data in Insomnia once the routes have been established. I learned a lot about creating Models using the Sequelize format, creating API routes (Get, Put, Create, etc), one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, and using Insomnia to perform RESTful CRUD operations

## Installation 

First run: mysql -u root -p to connect to a MySQL database 
Then run: source db/schema.sql
Then create database (ecommerce_db)
Control-D 
Then run: npm run seed to seed your data 
Npm run start to start the application
